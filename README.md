Located in this repository are several Python scripts built to run a single game of poker. The SGE_Main or "Single Game Engine" simulates a single hand of poker with a variable number of players/hands. It is designed to easily fit into the OGE, or "Ongoing Game Engine" which involves a running count of pot values, etc.
